# Real-Time-Parkinson-Disease-Detector
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a long-term degenerative disorder of the central nervous 
system that mainly affects the motor system. It affects 7–10 million people worldwide. The 
combination of Environmental influences (exposure to chemicals and toxins) and genetic 
inheritance or genetic factors (caused by genetic mutation) are the main causes of Parkinson's 
disease. The most obvious early symptoms are tremor, rigidity, slowness of movement, and 
difficulty walking. Physical activity (exercise improves gait, balance, tremor, and flexibility) and 
Diet (walnuts, cashews, and other nuts to promote brain health and foods that may have 
beneficial antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects in the brain) can help prevent or delay the 
onset of PD. This project focuses on predicting Parkinson’s disease using spiral and wave 
drawings. Spiral or wave drawing is a skilled, complex, and coordinated motor activity. The 
main idea behind the implementation is to classify a person as healthy or having Parkinson’s 
disease by looking at the spiral or wave drawings made by the person. This drawing created by a 
healthy person will look almost similar to a standard spiral or wave shape. A person with 
Parkinson’s Disease will highly deviate from a perfect spiral or wave shape. Then look distorted 
due to slow motor movements and decreased coordination between hand and brain.

Streamlit:

Role: Create user-friendly web applications for interaction with the machine learning model.

Functionality:

Collect user input (e.g., upload voice samples, record drawing tasks).

Display the results of the machine learning analysis.

Provide an intuitive interface for users, even without technical expertise.

OpenCV Canvas:

Role:  OpenCV is a library for image and video processing. A "canvas" in this context refers to a space where users can perform actions that OpenCV can capture and analyze.

Functionality in Parkinson's Detection:

Drawing Analysis: Patients could draw specific patterns on a canvas within the Streamlit app. OpenCV can then analyze these drawings for features like tremor or micrographia (small handwriting), which are Parkinson's symptoms.

Movement Tracking: If combined with a video feed, OpenCV could track hand movements or gait patterns.

In essence: Machine learning models detect patterns, Streamlit provides the interface, and OpenCV helps capture and process relevant data from user actions.
